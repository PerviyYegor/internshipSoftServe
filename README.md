Welcome to my DevOps Training Repository for my internship at SoftServe!

In this repository, you will find a collection of completed DevOps tasks and projects that I have worked on as part of my internship program at SoftServe. These tasks cover a wide range of DevOps concepts and practices, allowing me to gain hands-on experience in building, deploying, and maintaining applications in a DevOps environment.
